# Darkness Detector

* Intro 
  * Maybe we should open by citing what Latour said about morality lying not with the human but with the human plus their retinue of delegated actors? And to that end, we made one device but envisioned two uses, each inspired by a different reading and each with a different morality.
* Motivation behind the project
  * Statements in the readings + current events that Ed wanted to explore
    * Borgmann's argument that engatement with a time, a place, and a community are morally valuable, and that technology creates disengagement -- can we design something that encourages engagement, instead of forcing disengagement?
    * [def change this as you see fit!]
  * Statements in the readings that A wanted to explore
    * [to add]
* Presenting the device
  * Process
    * We were severely constrained by our own skills or lack thereof -- this is essentially an intro-level example with variables and sensor swapped out
    * We brainstormed as a group. Ed did a fantastic job compiling notes on the readings. A did much of the wiring and coding, Ed put it all together and designed the packaging.
  * Basic functionality/demo
  * Can the user control the threshold for "too dark", the amount of time before the device goes off?
  * Deployment as an accountability alarm/get-out-of-the-darkness-device
  * Deployment as an externally embedded device
